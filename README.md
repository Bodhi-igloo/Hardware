 Lithium Ion Battery model - Simulink:
In this project Panasonic CGR 18650CG battey model was built. Based on the parameters from datatsheet a battery model is constructed and simulated in Simulink to understand their performance behavior. In this project we are going to concentrate on a lithium ion battery and its characteristics. There are 3 different approaches which we are planning on considering when modelling the battery.
⦁	Generic battery model 
⦁	Generic battery model – connected to an external load
⦁	Generic battery model - connected to an external resistive load 
The voltage, power and state of charge (SOC) curves are plotted and then compared to check their validity with real world operation.  A Thevenin based model is also developed and checked with the same operating parameters.

 Dependent souce circuit simulation - LTspice:
 In this project a conceptual demo for voltage controlled voltage source is simulated
